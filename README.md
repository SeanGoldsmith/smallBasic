  The program I wrote in example 5 containes "entrance" in that it is executable.  When the program is run, control is switched to the
  program from the operating system.

  It contains Control/Branching in that it makes decisions as it runs.  The if statement finds out if the London office is open.  If it
  is, a file is copied.  If it is not, nothing occurs.  This is branching.

  This program only contains one variable, timeCheck.  It is set based on what time it is on the West coast of the US, then augmented to
  represent the time in London.

  It contains a subprogram called Copy.  When the button is clicked, control goes from the main program to the sub program.  When
  everything in the sub program is finished. Control is given back to the main program. 

  This program has exit through functionality built into small-basic. When the x is clicked, the program stops.
